<h1>Welcome to the TinyTIM WWW Page!</h1>
<h2>Commonly known as our HTML Resource, or, simply, "Owen's
Brother, Phil"</h2>

<hr>

This site is provided as a service to help people who have
had their interaction with the Internet reduced to a series
of Icon Clicking and moving a little bar around. It's time to
expand your horizons with TinyTIM!

TinyTIM is the world's oldest running MUSH (Multi-User Shared
Hallucination), over 18 years old
It's a lot of fun and beats getting run over by a car.

To get more pages and stuff, simply choose one of the following
three areas and follow the link that best describes what's going
through your mind at the moment. Nothing could be easier!

<h3>Never used TinyTIM</h3>
"I've never used TinyTIM before. I was sure this was going to
be a <A HREF="thesinger.html">WWW page about the singer</A>! Where's 
<A HREF="sounds/tiptoe.au">"Tiptoe through the Tulips" in .au form</a>? 
Oh, well. <A HREF="whatstim.html">What the hell is 
this TinyTIM thing?</A> 
<A HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se:7500/lysator/../mud/faq/faq1.html"> 
What are MUSHes</A>? Where am I?"

<h3>Used TinyTIM, want to expand experience</h3>
"Of <EM>course</EM> I use TinyTIM! 
<A HREF="programs/players.php">Everybody
uses TinyTIM!</A>
Some people are even using TinyTIM <a href="programs/WHO.php">right now!</a>
  TinyTIM is one of the basic four
food groups. What I really want is to expand my addiction to
TinyTIM by getting 
<A HREF="timpics">pictures</A>, sounds, 
<!--<A HREF="/help/helpmain.html">documentation</A>-->
and
<A HREF="blurbs">blurbs</A> about my all-time favorite Internet
Experience and its <A HREF="/reviews">well-read</A>
<A HREF="wizards">wizards</A>... and then I'll get the
<A HREF="/merchandise">t-shirt</A>."

<h3>Clicks on random icons in WWW pages</h3>
"Uh, I'm looking for weather maps 
of Africa."
